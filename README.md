# My Personal Website
This is a website deployed through GitHub pages that i planned, designed, and programmed from scratch. I made this website using basic HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript, alongside the CSS framework, Bootstrap for an easier grid layout.<br>

Despite only creating 3 sections for my website, I am quite proud of how minimalistic and asthetic each section is; I am particularly proud of my profile card in my "About Me" section and the timeline in my "Experience and Projects" section. Overall, I put a lot of effort under the hood making everything look clean and nice for this project as I wanted to create a website akin to the professionals.<br>

Throughout programming the website I came across several roadblocks. The main difficulty I had when coding was ensuring the design and layout remained as similar as possible across different window sizes and screen resolutions. I first started programming the website on my large 1440p monitor only to discover that elements would become off center or cut off on my other smaller 1440p monitor, with intensified effects on smaller 1080p screens. I am aware that my site does not need to be mobile friendly, but I did not know what size and resolution screen the professor or TA would be looking at my site with. In short, there was a lot of trial and error making elements and styling mostly consistent across the major screen sizes and resolutions.
