# My Personal Website
This is a website deployed through GitHub pages that i planned, designed, and programmed from scratch. I made this website using basic HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript, alongside the CSS framework, Bootstrap for an easier grid layout.<br>

Despite only creating 3 sections for my website, I am quite proud of how minimalistic and aesthetic each section is; I am particularly proud of my profile card in my "About Me" section and the timeline in my "Experience and Projects" section. Overall, I put a lot of effort under the hood making everything look clean and nice for this project as I wanted to create a website akin to the professionals.<br>

Throughout programming the website I came across several roadblocks. The main difficulty I had when coding was ensuring the design and layout remained as similar as possible across different window sizes and screen resolutions. I first started programming the website on my large 1440p monitor only to discover that elements would become off center or cut off on my other smaller 1440p monitor, with intensified effects on smaller 1080p screens. I am aware that my site does not need to be mobile friendly, but I did not know what size and resolution screen the professor or TA would be looking at my site with. In short, there was a lot of trial and error making elements and styling mostly consistent across the major screen sizes and resolutions. <br>

For the future, I plan on iterating, bug fixing, and adding new features to this website. For example, I plan on adding a JavaScript feature that fades in the umseen elements while scrolling down the page.


# Features

* Image preview feature that showcases the corresponding image on hover of each project or work experience item. When hovered, the item's image fades in and remains on screen while the cursor stays in the item's area. When the cursor leaves the area, the images then fades out.
* Smooth scrolling when clicking on differect sections of the website
* Responsive buttons when hovered

# License

I chose the MIT license for my personal website because I was inspired by the layouts of other professional online portfolios and feel copywriting my work that was inspired by others is wrong. Furthermore, I am very proud of the overall look of my website and invite others to utilize my design for their own websites too. <br>
